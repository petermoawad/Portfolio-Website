                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h5>Computer Engineering Student</h5>
                <p>
                    I am a third-year computer engineering student with a deep passion for both hardware design and the practical application of technology. 
                    Born in Qatar to an Egyptian family, I was inspired to pursue engineering by my father and sister, who are both engineers. 
                    Their influence, combined with my own curiosity and enthusiasm for technology, led me to this exciting field. I love computer engineering 
                    because it allows me to create innovative applications and gadgets that can benefit others and solve real-world problems.
                    While I enjoy coding and the challenge it presents, my true passion lies in bringing those codes to life through tangible creations. 
                    I thrive on designing and building machines, robotics, chip designs, and various electronics, where I can witness my coded creations in action. 
                    This blend of software and hardware engineering fuels my creativity and drive, allowing me to transform abstract ideas into functional and impactful solutions.
